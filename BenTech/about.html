    <h1>About BenTech</h1>

    <p>BenTech is more than just a creative coding experiment - it's a digital world where imagination and interface collide. It was created by Benjamin, a passionate young developer who wanted to build something that looks like aan operating system but is entirely made with web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

    <p>With BenTech, you're not just using a website. You're exploring a simulated system with it's own apps, terminal, sound and design philosophy. whether you're clicking through "apps" or diving into the terminals to mock commands, there's always a layer of surprise waiting for you.</p>

    <p>**Why was BenTech created?**</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To practice frontend development in a fun way</li>
        <li>To showcase creativity, design, and code all in one place</li>
        <li>To learn by doing, testing, and building cool features</li>
        <li>To create something unique and personal</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the future, BenTech might evolve with interactive features, animations, and even mini-games. 
        But for now, this is your portal into a world built line by line with passion.
